                Please read it carefully. Then create exactly {num_questions} multiple-choice questions based on the information presented.

                For each question:
                1. Write the question clearly.
                2. Provide four answer options labeled "A", "B", "C", "D".
                3. Identify one correct answer from among these options.
                4. Make sure the correct answer is accurate and derived from the reference text.

                Your answer should be in the following JSON array format:

                [
                    {{
